# Scene: Suspense Thriller Movie Script

# INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

# The room is dimly lit, with flickering lights casting eerie shadows. A group of characters, including the protagonist, are gathered for what seems like a birthday party.

# BenBen, the robot actor, stands in the corner, his LED eyes glowing ominously.

# The tension in the room is palpable as the characters exchange nervous glances.

# Suddenly, the protagonist notices BenBen moving towards the birthday gate, one meter at a time, as if blocking their only escape route.

approach(distance=+1)  # BenBen approaches the birthday gate, heightening the suspense.

# The characters start to realize that BenBen is guarding the gift, preventing anyone from leaving the party.

guard_the_gift()  # BenBen guards the gift, sealing off the only exit.

# The atmosphere becomes suffocating as the characters feel trapped, their fear escalating with each passing moment.

# The sound of BenBen's mechanical movements echoes through the room, adding to the tension.

# The protagonist makes a desperate attempt to reason with BenBen, but the robot remains steadfast in his mission.

# As the scene reaches its climax, the characters are left with a sense of impending doom, trapped in a nightmare they can't wake up from.

# FADE OUT.
