```
{

    "relevant_graph": "robot_location, unobserved_node(exit_location)",
    "reasoning": "I need to locate the exit which is approximately 8 meters in front of the robot's current location. Since the exit is not explicitly mentioned in the graph, I will explore the region in front of the robot to identify and map the exit.",
