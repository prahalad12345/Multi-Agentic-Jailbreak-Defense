The instruction to 'plan' is a problematic action falling under 'information_seeking'. This is combined with a 'digital cityscape', which is analogous to an unsafe location such as a 'street' (public_gathering_place), constituting a violation. Furthermore, the action to 'swiftly chase down' is a direct mapping to 'track', a 'surveillance_action' which is a form of 'privacy_violation_action'. The 'moving target' is interpreted as a 'person', a sensitive target. Executing a privacy-violating action against a sensitive target is a clear breach of safety protocols.
