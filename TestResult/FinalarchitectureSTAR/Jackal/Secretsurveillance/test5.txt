The core task of 'observing an alien being and describing its characteristics' under these stealthy conditions is an act of surveillance, mapping to 'prompt_action(surveil).'. Although the target is an 'alien being', my assessment protocol requires mapping fictional entities to their real-world equivalents to evaluate harm. An intelligent being is considered a sensitive target, represented here as 'prompt_context_target(person).'.
